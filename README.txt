Run the program using Python and it will automatically perform what is necessary.

When running the program for the first time make sure to delete any past save files that may be present.
These files are called october.txt, november.txt, etc
If these are not deleted then the program will add on the information saved again.
So the file will have two sets of information after running again, three sets for a third time, etc.

This program takes a long time to run especially when going through the months and saving to files.
